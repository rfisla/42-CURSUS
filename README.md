# 42-CURSUS

After going through an intensive selection proccess for one month, I am currently a 42 Madrid student, an innovative programming course developed by the Telef√≥nica Foundation (https://www.42madrid.com/). 

I'll post every project I'll made during my cursus.

For the moment all the projects will be done with the programming language C.
