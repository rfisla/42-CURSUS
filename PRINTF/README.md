## FT_PRINTF  PROJECT (42CURSUS)

This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming.

#### The prototype of ft_printf should be:
```int ft_printf(const char *, ...);```
- It will manage the following conversions: cspdiuxX% and it will be compared with the real printf
- It will anage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.' '#+’ and minimum field width with all conversions
