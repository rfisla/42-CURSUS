## SO_LONG PROJECT (42 CURSUS)

As a graphic design project, so_long project will enable to improve the skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, textures, etc.

I've created a small 2D game where the character has to collect the valuables, and avoid the enemies (bonus part) before going to the exit.

The rules that the maps need to follow in order to consider them correct are listed in the subject attached to this repo. 

The program takes as a first argument a map description file with the .ber extension, reads the map and displays the game.

## Compilation and execution

Clone the repo in your terminal and compile with ```make``` to obtain the ```so_long``` program, and ```make bonus``` to obtain the ```so_long_bonus``` program (with enemies and a movement counter directly displayed on the screen instead of on the shell output).

The folders maps and maps_bonus contain some map examples.

Some tests:
- ```./so_long maps/big.ber```
- ```./so_long_bonus maps_bonus/map2.ber```
- ```./so_long_bonus maps_bonus/another_4.ber```
